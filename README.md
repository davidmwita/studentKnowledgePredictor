# Data Science Project: Determining Student Knowledge Status

Understanding how student study methods and examination results affect the retention of information is essential to create better teaching and learning methodologies. At a university in Turkey, Ph.D students collected data on undergraduate students' understanding of Electrical DC Machines. They utilized five normalized characteristics to determine the knowledge level of students from very low to high. The five variables included the amount of study time, number of repetitions and exam performance for goal object materials as well as the amount of study time and exam performance for related objects with the goal object.  

Through this project, we propose to answer the following question:
> Given the degree of preparation and examination results of a student, what will be the knowledge retention level of said student?  

We aim to achieve this by training a model that, given the five aforementioned characteristics, will classify the knowledge level of a student.
